# Image-Classification-Sea-Animals

 
This repository contains code and documentation for an assignment focused on implementing Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for the classification of sea animal images into five categories: Crabs, Sea Rays, Sea Urchins, Seahorse, and Sharks. The assignment is divided into two main tasks:

Task 1: CNN Architecture Implementation and Evaluation
Implementing and evaluating two CNN architectures (CNN 1 and CNN 2) for image classification, each with a different architecture and training setup.
Detailed descriptions of CNN architectures, including layers, activation functions, loss functions, and optimization algorithms.
Training each model with a specified number of epochs and batch sizes.
Analysis of training accuracy during training for both models.

Task 2: Fine-Tuning and Evaluation
Fine-tuning one of the CNN models and evaluating its performance on the test data.
Description of the fine-tuning process and training setup.
Evaluation of the fine-tuned model's performance on the test data, including accuracy results.
